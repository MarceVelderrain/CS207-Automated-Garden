## Requirements and materials
Bill of materials: 
- An Arduino (this project uses Arduino Uno which means it can control up to 6 irrigators, to control more an Arduino Mega can be used)
- A plant 
- A 9V-  DC, 1 amp power transformer for the Arduino
- 2-conductor, low voltage wire (22–24 AWG)
- A small enclosure for the Arduino 
- 10 red LEDs 
- 10 blue LEDs 
- 5 green LEDs 
- Between 1 and 6 moisture sensor (if you're using moisture pre-built moisture sensors)
- To build your own moisture sensors you'll need the following material for each sensor: 
  - A 10 kohm resistor 
  - 2-conductor, low voltage wire (22–24 AWG)
  - A very short length of 15mm outside diameter clear vinyl tube
  - Two 50mm (2") galvanized finishing nails
  - About 50g of plaster of Paris (calcium sulfate hemihydrate) 
  - Adhesive tape
- For each irrigator: 
  - A TIP120 power transistor
  - A 1N4007 or similar diode
  - A 12V DC 2-port water/air solenoid valve
  - About a meter of 6mm outside diameter flexible nylon tube 
  - A 2-liter beverage bottle
