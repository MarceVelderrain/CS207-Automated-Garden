## Requirements and materials
Bill of materials: 
- An Arduino (this project uses Arduino Uno which means it can control up to 6 irrigators, to control more an Arduino Mega can be used)
- Between 1 and 6 plants 
- A 9V-DC, 1 amp power transformer for the Arduino 
- 2-conductor, low voltage wire (22–24 AWG)
- A small enclosure for the Arduino 
- 8 red LEDs 
- 8 blue LEDs 
- 9 green LEDs 
- Between 1 and 6 moisture sensor (if you're using moisture pre-built moisture sensors)
- Hot glue gun 
- To build your own moisture sensors you'll need the following material for each sensor: 
  - A 10 kohm resistor 
  - 2-conductor, low voltage wire (22–24 AWG)
  - A very short length of 15mm outside diameter clear vinyl tube
  - Two 50mm (2") galvanized finishing nails
  - About 50g of plaster of Paris (calcium sulfate hemihydrate) 
  - Adhesive tape
  - Soldering iron and soldering wire
  - A small container filled with rice
- For each irrigator: 
  - A TIP120 power transistor
  - A 1N4007 or similar diode
  - A 12V DC 2-port water/air solenoid valve
  - About a meter of 6mm outside diameter flexible nylon tube 
  - A 2-liter beverage bottle 
  
## Build instructions 
To create your own moisture sensor you should follow the following steps: 
1. Take the two galvanized nails place them parallel to each other, use the hot glue gun to ensure that the nails don´t touch each other. 
2. Cut about 57mm (2.25") of the 15mm outside diameter clear vinyl tube this will be used as a mold for the sensor, also cut along the tube (this is so the sensor is easier to unmold in step ). 
3. Use the adhesive tape to unite the paralel cut you just made from the outside and to seal one of the ends of the tube. 
4. Make a mixture of 2 parts of plaster of Paris and 1 part of water. 
5. Place the vinyl tube in the container filled with rice in a way that open side of the tube is facing up and isn't sumerged by the rice, this will hold the mold upright while the plaster sets.  
6. Fill the tube with the plaster, try to fill it so that there aren't any air bubbles inside the tube. 
7. Carefully push the two galvanized nails into the plaster leave the top of the nails uncovered, make sure that the nails aren't touching the walls of the mold. 
8. Let it set for an hour and check if it still wet, if its still wet enough that you can deform it from the top let it set for another hour. 
9. Tke the moisture sensor out of the mold and let it dry until it is completly dry. 
10. Take a piece of the 2 conductor wire, make it long enough so that it'll reach your the breadboard from the plant or plants. 
11. Trim the wires, solder them to the top of the nails and let it dry.
